## <span>H</span>ey, I'm Max

I do many things! Right now, I'm designing and developing websites. I love structuring information and playing with CSS until every webpage is responsive in just the right way. My specialty right now lies with front-end development for static webpages, but I'm aiming to expand my horizons to include dynamic CMS pages and full-stack engineering.

In my free time, I'm a fantasy artist who loves worldbuilding; I'm a game developer that makes short indie projects; and I'm a huge fan of *Dungeon Meshi*. Ask me about my favorite films, games, or anime!

**I am looking for full-time positions in web development, front-end or full-stack. I am willing to relocate!**

Want to hire me? Want me to make you a landing page? Wanna talk about games? Feel free to reach out to me for any reason at [maxniederergvc@gmail.com](mailto:maxniederergvc@gmail.com). (Except for spam, I guess. Please don't send me junkmail.)
