Eric is a computer engineer & software developer who wanted a refresh to his portfolio website. He disliked paying a subscription to Squarespace and wanted a more streamlined workflow to updating his site. He also dicussed potentially hosting a blog in the future.

For this project, I used 11ty for its easy integration with blog-style websites. We are hosting the website with Netlify because it's free for Eric and I wanted to utilize Netlify's synergy with Decap CMS. Eric is familiar with Git processes, and he was able to use the admin panel with GitHub right away.

This website is complete with 6 different themes and a contact form that emails Eric on new responses.

### Tech Stack

- **11ty**: for generating the static website
- **Bootstrap**: for basic styling
- **SASS**: for advanced styling
- **Netlify**: for deployment
- **Decap CMS**: for content management
- **Github**: for version control & Netlify setup
