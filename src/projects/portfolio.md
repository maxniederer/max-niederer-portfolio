A portfolio site for my web development ventures.

I was inspired to start making websites after wanting more customization from free HTML templates and becoming insurmountably annoyed with bloated Squarespace pages. Every single Squarespace page I've ever loaded up nearly crashes my Firefox when changing the viewport size, it's ridiculous.

### Tech Stack

- **11ty**: for generating the static website
- **Bootstrap**: for responsiveness
  - I ended up opting for flex boxes and grids instead of Bootstrap's columns, so this site doesn't use Bootstrap too much, lol
- **SASS**: for styling
- **Netlify**: for deployment
- **Github**: for version control & Netlify setup
