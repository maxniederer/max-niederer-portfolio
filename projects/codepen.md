On my CodePen you can find:

1. **YouTube Thumbnail Previewer**: A tool to preview thumbnail and title combinations for YouTube videos

2. **Bionic Reading (WIP)**: A script that takes all \<p\> elements on a page and dynamically adjusts the boldness of each word to facilitate faster reading. Not 100% complete!

There are some other miscellaneous front-end practice pens you can browse as well :\)
