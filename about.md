title: Hey, I'm Max
---

I'm a developer, illustrator, and multidisciplinary designer who's creating websites to bridge the gap between my technical background and my artistic skillset. I love structuring information, pairing fonts and colors on webpages, and twiddling with CSS for hours.

In my free time, I'm a fantasy artist who loves worldbuilding; I'm a game developer that makes short indie projects; and I'm a huge fan of _Dungeon Meshi_. Ask me about my favorite films, games, or anime!

I am looking for work. If you're an employer, or if you want me to make you a landing page, or if you just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me for any reason at [maxniederergvc@gmail.com](mailto:maxniederergvc@gmail.com). (Except for spam, I guess. Please don't send me junkmail.)
